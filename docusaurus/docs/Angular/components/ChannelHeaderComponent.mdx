import ChannelHeaderScreenshot from "../assets/channel-header-screenshot.png";

The `ChannelHeader` component displays the avatar and name of the currently active channel along with member and watcher information. You can read about [the difference between members and watchers](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/watch_channel/?language=javascript#watchers-vs-members) in the platform documentation. Please note that number of watchers is only displayed if the user has [`connect-events` capability](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/channel_capabilities/?language=javascript)

**Example 1** - Channel header:

<img src={ChannelHeaderScreenshot} width="500" />

## Customization

If you want to, you can create your own custom channel header, here is how to use it:

```html
<stream-channel-list></stream-channel-list>
<stream-channel>
  <custom-channel-header></custom-channel-header>
  <stream-message-list></stream-message-list>
  <stream-notification-list></stream-notification-list>
  <stream-message-input></stream-message-input>
</stream-channel>
```

If you create your own channel header, you can use the [`ChannelService`](../services/ChannelService.mdx) to access the currently active channel. Please note that, the default channel header also contains the menu button to [toggle the channel list](../services/ChannelListToggleService.mdx). Here is a simple implementation of a custom channel header to guide you:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "custom-channel-header",
  template: `
    <button (click)="toggleMenu()">Menu</button>
    {{ activeChannel?.data?.name }}
  `,
  styles: [],
})
export class ChannelHeaderComponent {
  activeChannel: Channel | undefined;

  constructor(
    private channelService: ChannelService,
    private channelListToggleService: ChannelListToggleService
  ) {
    this.channelService.activeChannel$.subscribe(
      (c) => (this.activeChannel = c)
    );
  }

  toggleMenu() {
    this.channelListToggleService.toggle();
  }
}
```
