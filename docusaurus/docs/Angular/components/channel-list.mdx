The `ChannelList` component renders the list of channels.

The `ChannelList` displays channels using pagination, new channels are loaded if the user clicks the "Load more" button.

The channel list is always visible on desktop devices, on mobile devices, the list can be opened or closed controlled by a button in the [`ChannelHeader`](./channel-header.mdx) component.

## Customization

**Example 1** - Using a custom channel list component

If you want to create a custom channel list component, here is how to use it:

```html
<custom-channel-list></custom-channel-list>
<stream-channel>
  <stream-channel-header></stream-channel-header>
  <stream-message-list></stream-message-list>
  <stream-message-input></stream-message-input>
</stream-channel>
```

:::note
If you want to create your own channel list, you can use the [`ChannelService`](../services/channel.mdx) to receive the channels and interact with the Stream API.

Other building blocks, that you might find useful:

### Toggle

The channel list is always visible on desktop devices, on mobile devices, the list can be opened or closed controlled by a button in the `ChannelHeader` component. The open/close mechanism is implemented by the [`ChannelListToggleService`](../services/channel-list-toggle.mdx).

### Loading indicator

The `ChannelList` component uses the [`LoadingIndicator`](./loading-indicator.mdx) component to display a spinner while more channels are being fetched.

### Icons

The `ChannelList` component uses the [`Icon`](./icons.mdx) component to display icons.

**Example 2** - Using a custom channel preview component

If you only want to customize the channel preview items (not the whole list), see the [channel preview customization](./channel-preview.mdx/#customization) guide.

## Inputs

By default, the [default preview component](./channel-preview.mdx) is used. To change the contents of the channel list, [provide your own custom template](./channel-preview.mdx/#customization).
