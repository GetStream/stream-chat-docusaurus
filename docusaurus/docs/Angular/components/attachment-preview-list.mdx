The `AttachmentPreviewList` compontent displays a preview of the attachments uploaded to a message. Users can delete attachments using the preview component, or retry upload if it failed previously.

**Example 1** - attachment previews

<img src={Screenshot} width="1000" />

## Basic Usage

A typical use case for the `AttachmentPreviewList` component would be to use in your custom components that will completely override the message input component.

**Example 1** - a basic example:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "app-custom-message-input",
  template: `
    <stream-attachment-preview-list></stream-attachment-list>
    <!-- Other parts of the custom message input component -->
  `,
})
export class CustomMessageInputComponent {}
```

The `AttachmentPreviewList` uses the [`AttachmentService`](../services/AttachmentService.mdx) to display the attachment previews.
