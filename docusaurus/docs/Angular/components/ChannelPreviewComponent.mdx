The `ChannelPreview` component displays a channel preview in the channel list, it consists of the image, name (or list of members if name isn't defined) and latest message of the channel.

## Customization

The channel list uses the `ChannelPreview` component to display channels, if you want to replace that with your own custom component you can use the [`CustomTemplatesService`](../services/CustomTemplatesService.mdx/#channelpreviewtemplate).
