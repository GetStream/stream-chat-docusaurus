The `AttachmentList` compontent displays the attachments of a message. The following attachments are supported:

- Images (including GIFs) are displayed inline
- Videos are displayed inline
- Other files can be downloaded
- Links in a message are enriched with built-in open graph URL scraping

**Example 1** - different type of attachments:

<img src={AttachmentsScreenshot} width="500" />

## Basic Usage

A typical use case for the `AttachmentList` component would be to use in your custom components that will completely override the message component.

**Example 1** - a basic example:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "app-custom-message",
  template: `
    <stream-attachment-list
      *ngIf="hasAttachment"
      [attachments]="message.attachments"
    ></stream-attachment-list>
    <!-- Other parts of the custom message component -->
  `,
})
export class CustomMessageComponent {
  @Input() message: StreamMessage;
  hasAttachment: boolean;
}
```

## Customization

You can provide your own attachment list component by the [`CustomTemplatesService`](../services/CustomTemplatesService.mdx)
