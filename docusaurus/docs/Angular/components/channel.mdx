The `Channel` component is a container component that displays the [`ChannelHeader`](./channel-header.mdx), [`MessageList`](./message-list.mdx), [`NotificationList`](./notifications.mdx) and [`MessageInput`](./message-input.mdx) components.

## Customization

If you want to create a custom channel component, here is how to use it:

```html
<div id="root">
  <stream-channel-list></stream-channel-list>
  <custom-channel>
    <stream-channel-header></stream-channel-header>
    <stream-message-list></stream-message-list>
    <stream-notification-list></stream-notification-list>
    <stream-message-input></stream-message-input>
  </custom-channel>
</div>
```

The `Channel` component doesn't do any settings, it's just displays its children components. The main purpose of this component is to provide the layout for the initial chat UI.
