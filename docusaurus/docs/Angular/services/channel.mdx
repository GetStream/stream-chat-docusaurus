| `channel.hidden`                    | Remove channel from the list                                       | `customChannelHiddenHandler`                  |

| `channel.visible`                   | Adds the channel to the list                                       | `customChannelVisibleHandler`                 |
| `message.new`                       | Moves the channel to top of the list                               | `customNewMessageHandler`                     |

| `notification.removed_from_channel` | Removes the channel from the list                                  | `customRemovedFromChannelNotificationHandler` |

It's important to note that filters don't apply to updates to the list from events.

Our platform documentation covers the topic of [channel events](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/event_object/?language=javascript#events) in depth.

## activeChannel$

Emits the currently active channel.

:::important
Please note that for performance reaasons the client is connected [outside of the NgZone](https://angular.io/guide/zone#ngzone-1), if you want to subscribe to [notification or channel events](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/event_object/?language=javascript), you will need to [reenter the NgZone](https://angular.io/guide/zone#ngzone-run-and-runoutsideofangular) or call change detection manually (you can use the [`ChangeDetectorRef`](https://angular.io/api/core/ChangeDetectorRef) or the [`ApplicationRef`](https://angular.io/api/core/ApplicationRef) for that).
