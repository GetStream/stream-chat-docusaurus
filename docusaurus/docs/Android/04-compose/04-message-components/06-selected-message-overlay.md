# SelectedMessageOverlay

The `SelectedMessageOverlay` component allows you to show different message options to the user, when they select a message in the `MessageList`. This is usually done through long tapping on an item.

This is a **stateless component** that you can easily add to your UI, if you're building a custom Messages screen. Internally, it sets up the following components:

* `ReactionOptions`: Shows a list of reactions the user can use to react to the message. Those reactions are shown as `ReationOptionItem`s in a `Row`.
* `SelectedMessage`: Shows the currently selected message. This UI is much simpler than the message item UI used to show messages in a list.
* `MessageOptions`: Shows a list of actions the user can take with the selected message, such as **delete**, **edit**, **reply to** and **start a thread** actions. These actions are shown as `MessageOptionItem`s in a `Column`.

Let's see how to use it!

## Usage

If you're using the `MessagesScreen`, the `SelectedMessageOverlay` is already set up for you. To use the `SelectedMessageOverlay` in your custom screens, simply add it to your UI, like so:

```kotlin
// the rest of your UI
if (selectedMessage != null) {
    SelectedMessageOverlay(
        // message options
        messageOptions = defaultMessageOptions(selectedMessage, user, listViewModel.isInThread),
        // message to show
        message = selectedMessage,
        onMessageAction = { action ->
            // handle message action
        },
        onDismiss = { 
            // handle dismiss
        }
    )
}
```

As you can see, adding the overlay is very simple. If a `selectedMessage` exists, you pass in the message options you want to expose to the user, as well as the selected message. The reactions you show are taken from the `ChatTheme` component and everything else required to show the component is taken care internally.

This small snippet produces the following UI.

As you can see, the reactions you can take are shown on the top, followed by the selected message and finally by message actions.

You can also see the overlay has a darker background, which if tapped dismisses the component.

## Handling Actions

There are two actions the `SelectedMessageOverlay` exposes, as per the signature:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SelectedMessageOverlay(
    ..., // state and options
    onMessageAction: (MessageAction) -> Unit,
    onDismiss: () -> Unit,
)
```

* `onMessageAction`: Handler when the user makes any message actions, such as **reply**, **edit**, **delete**, **react** and others.
* `onDismiss`: Handler when the component is dismissed after clicking outside of the component UI.

To handle these actions, you can override them like so:

```kotlin
if (selectedMessage != null) {
    SelectedMessageOverlay(
        ..., // state and options
        onMessageAction = { action ->
            composerViewModel.onMessageAction(action)
			listViewModel.onMessageAction(action)
        },
        onDismiss = {
			listViewModel.removeOverlay()
        }
    )
}
```

In the snippet above, you propagate the `action` to the `composerViewModel` and `listViewModel`, for them to store the latest action. This will update the UI accordingly.

Alternatively, you call `listViewModel.removeOverlay()` to remove the overlay from the screen, in `onDismiss()`. It's important to note that `onMessageAction()` calls `removeOverlay()` internally, to hide the overlay.

Next, let's see how to customize the overlay.

## Customization

Even though this is a **stateless component**, it doesn't allow for much customization because it's very specific and uses many default properties that we provide internally. However, you can still customize the reactions you show, as well as the message options, as per the signature:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SelectedMessageOverlay(
    reactionTypes: Map<String, Int> = ChatTheme.reactionTypes,
    messageOptions: List<MessageOption>,
    ... // message and actions
)
```

* `reactionTypes`: Allows you customize which reactions show in the overlay. By default it uses `ChatTheme.reactionTypes` that is exposed through the `ChatTheme` component.
* `messageOptions`: Allows you to customize which message options are shown in the overlay. By default it uses `defaultMessageOptions()` that we expose in our SDK.

If you want to customize these options or reactions, you can set up custom reactions, using the [ChatTheme](../05-general-customization/01-chat-theme.md) `reactionTypes` parameter.
