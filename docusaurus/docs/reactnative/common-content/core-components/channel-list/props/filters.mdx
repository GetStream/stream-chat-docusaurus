Filter object, used to query channels from Stream. You can query on any of the custom fields you've defined on the Channel. You can also filter other built-in channel fields.

See [Channels Query Docs](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/query_channels) for a list of available `filter` fields.

#### Example

```js
// Filter to query channels, which user 'vishal' and 'jaap' are members of.
const filter = {
  type: 'messaging',
  members: {
    $in: ['vishal', 'jaap']
  }
}
```

:::caution
Avoid using inline objects as props. Please memoize the object before passing it to ChannelList component or use static reference to filters object.
