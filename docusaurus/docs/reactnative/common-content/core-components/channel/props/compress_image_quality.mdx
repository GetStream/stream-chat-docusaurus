Compress image with quality (from 0 to 1, where 1 is best quality) before uploading.
On iOS, values larger than 0.8 don't produce a noticeable quality increase in most images,
while a value of 0.8 will reduce the file size by about half or less compared to a value of 1.
Image picker defaults to 0.8 for iOS and 1 for Android
