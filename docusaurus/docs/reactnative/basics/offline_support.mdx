title: Offline Support
---

React Native Chat SDK provides OOTB support for offline mode, which means user will be able to access and interact
with chat even when the network is off. This is an opt-in feature that needs to be explicitely enabled on application
level.

> Offline support is currently not supported for Expo package (stream-chat-expo).

## Features

- ✅ Access to channel list and message list without network
- ✅ Faster loading of chat since chat gets loaded from offline storage first before loading data from network
- ✅ Syncing the local database using websocket events and sync api (once network is recovered)
- ❌ Caching of image attachments
- ❌ Optimistic updates to database on user action in offline mode e.g., send message, add reaction etc

## How To Enable Offline Support

- **Upgrade stream-chat dependency (optional)**

  If you have installed `stream-chat` dependency explicitely on your application, then upgrade it to v7

  ```bash
  yarn add stream-chat@7.0.0
  ```

- **Add `react-native-quick-sqlite` dependency**

  ```bash
  yarn add react-native-quick-sqlite
  npx pod-install
  ```

- **Ensure unique instance of Chat component**

  Until v4, you could provide separate `Chat` component for each usage of `Channel` component or `ChannelList` component.
  But from v5, it is necessary that you provide only one instance of `Chat` component within your application.
  This component needs to be a parent for all the chat related components such as `ChannelList`, `Channel` or `Thread`.

- **Do not wait for `connectUser` call to succeed**

  It is important that you call `connectUser` method on chat client, before you render Chat components.
  But you don't need to wait for `connectUser` to succeed before rendering Chat components. This is to ensure:

  - Chat components have access to current user information, which is important to store/access offline data.
  - In case or slow or no network, Chat components will still load the chat data without waiting for connectUser to succeed.

  ```tsx {7,8,16}
  const chatClient = StreamChat.getInstance('API_KEY');
  const App = () => {
    const [isClientReady, setIsClientReady] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() => {
      const startChat = async () => {
        const connectPromise = chatClient.connectUser(user, tokenOrTokenProvider);
        setIsClientReady(true); // this allows components to render
        await connectPromise();
        // Any other post-connectUser logic you may have goes here.
      };

      startChat();
    }, []);

    if (!isClientReady) return null; // or some loading indicator;

    return (
      <Chat client={chatClient} enableOfflineSupport>
        ...
      </Chat>
    );
  };
  ```

- **Add `enableOfflineSupport` prop on Chat component**

  ```tsx
  import { Chat } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

  <Chat client={chatClient} enableOfflineSupport>
    ...
  </Chat>;
  ```

- **Reset the database when signing out the user**

  Since SDK doesn't handle the app level authentication logic, its application's responsibility
  to ensure resetting database when user gets logged out. This should be generally done before you
  call `client.disconnectUser()`

  ```jsx
  import { QuickSqliteClient } from 'stream-chat-react-native';

  // Sign out logic
  QuickSqliteClient.resetDB();
  chatClient.disconnectUser();
  ```
