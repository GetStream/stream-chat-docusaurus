### CSS

The preferred method for overriding the pre-defined styles in the library is a two step process.

First, import our bundled CSS into the file where you instantiate your chat application.

Second, locate any Stream styles you want to override using either the browser inspector or by viewing the library code.

You can then add selectors to your local CSS file to override our defaults. For example:

```jsx
import 'stream-chat-react/dist/css/index.css';
import './App.css';
```

### Theming

On the Stream Chat React roadmap is the addition of theming customization via CSS variables.
