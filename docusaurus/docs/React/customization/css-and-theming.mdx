While the components in the React Chat library come with basic styling, the look and feel can easily be adjusted to fit
your specifications. For small and precise changes, individual CSS classes can be overridden. For larger, theme-related
adjustments, the `Chat` component accepts a [`customStyles`](../core-components/chat.mdx#customstyles) prop which can toggle
a large selection of CSS variables.

## Overriding CSS

To override pre-defined library styles, follow this simple process:

- Import our bundled CSS into the file where you instantiate your chat application

- Use the browser inspector or view the library code and locate default styles you wish to override

- Add selectors to your local CSS file to override our defaults

- Import your local CSS file after Stream's bundled CSS

For example:

```jsx
import 'stream-chat-react/dist/css/index.css';
import './App.css';
```

## Importing scss Files

As an alternative to importing our entire style sheet (perhaps, due to it's size), there's also the option to easily assemble only what you need by importing individual scss files. The imports should happen in the file where you instantiate your application.

Here's a complete [list of scss files](https://unpkg.com/browse/stream-chat-react@6.4.7/dist/scss/) broken down by size and with the
option of filtering by SDK version.

:::note
If not importing our entire bundled CSS, individually importing the SDK's scss files is the better alternative to copy and pasting our stylesheets and then customizing that code in your application.
The CSS in the library does change occasionally, and you want to keep up to date with these to ensure no problems arise by falling behind in important styling updates.

## Theming Your App

To make more sweeping stylistic changes to the default CSS, the library exposes a variety of
[CSS variables](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react/blob/master/src/styles/_variables.scss) that can be
adjusted with props. The `Chat` component accepts a `customStyles` prop, an object type with keys as the CSS variables
you wish to change and values for the corresponding, adjusted CSS.

In the below example, we demonstrate how to change four of the library's global CSS variables:

- Primary color
- Medium font size
- Extra small margin
- Extra small padding

```tsx
const customStyles: CustomStyles = {
  '--primary-color': 'green',
  '--md-font': '1.2rem',
  '--xs-m': '1.2rem',
  '--xs-p': '1.2rem',
};

const App = () => (
  <Chat client={client} customStyles={customStyles}>
    <ChannelList />
    <Channel>
      <Window>
        <ChannelHeader />
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Window>
      <Thread />
    </Channel>
  </Chat>
);
```

The first screenshot shows an app running with the default library styling. In the second, we've supplied a
`customStyles` object to the `Chat` component to create a more zoomed-in user experience with a green primary
color.

### Default Styles

<img src={Theming1} alt='Theming1' width='700' />

### Custom CSS Variables

<img src={Theming2} alt='Theming2' width='700' />

### Simple Dark Mode

The `Chat` component also accepts a `darkMode` boolean prop that toggles the app into a basic dark mode setting.
The dark mode toggle is meant to point you in the right direction for building a custom theme into your app.

Adding the `darkMode` prop is equivalent to supplying to following object to `customStyles`:

```tsx
const darkModeTheme: CustomStyles = {
  '--bg-gradient-end': '#101214',
  '--bg-gradient-start': '#070a0d',
  '--black': '#ffffff',
  '--blue-alice': '#00193d',
  '--border': '#141924',
  '--button-background': '#ffffff',
  '--button-text': '#005fff',
  '--grey': '#7a7a7a',
  '--grey-gainsboro': '#2d2f2f',
  '--grey-whisper': '#1c1e22',
  '--modal-shadow': '#000000',
  '--overlay': '#00000066',
  '--overlay-dark': '#ffffffcc',
  '--shadow-icon': '#00000080',
  '--targetedMessageBackground': '#302d22',
  '--transparent': 'transparent',
  '--white': '#101418',
  '--white-smoke': '#13151b',
  '--white-snow': '#070a0d',
};
```

#### The result:

<img src={Theming3} alt='Theming3' width='700' />

### Variables Reference

A complete reference of all supported CSS variables, as well as their default values, can be found within our
[SCSS variables file](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react/blob/master/src/styles/_variables.scss).
Any of the CSS variables (prepended with `--`) can be overridden via the `customStyles` approach detailed
above.
